Project Overview

This Cisco Packet Tracer project simulates a network infrastructure for a small office with three departments: IT, Finance, and Customer Support (CS). The network connects various devices, including:

- Laptops
- PCs
- Printers
- Smartphones
- Access points

via switches and routers.

Network Architecture

The network design consists of:

- 3 departments (IT, Finance, CS) with separate subnetworks
- Each department has:
    - Laptops and PCs connected via switches
    - Printers connected to switches
    - Smartphones connected via access points
- Central router connecting departmental switches
- Redundant connections for high availability

Device Configuration

- Switches: configured for VLANs, trunking, and port security
- Routers: configured for static routing, NAT, and DHCP
- Access Points: configured for wireless connectivity and security
- Laptops, PCs, Printers, and Smartphones: configured with static IP addresses

Project Objectives

1. Design and implement a scalable office network infrastructure
2. Ensure secure and reliable connectivity between devices and departments
3. Optimize network performance and minimize congestion

Software Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer.
